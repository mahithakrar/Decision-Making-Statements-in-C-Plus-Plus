# Decision-Making-Statements-in-C-Plus-Plus

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **decision-making statements** in C++.  
These statements are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.  
They allow the program to make choices and take different actions based on user input or logical checks.

## Theory
Decision-making statements are a fundamental part of C++ programming.  
They help in making the program behave differently under different conditions.  
These include:

1. **if Statement**  
   Executes a block of code only if a given condition is true.

2. **if-else Statement**  
   Runs one block if the condition is true, and another if it's false.

3. **else-if Ladder**  
   Used when multiple conditions need to be checked one after another.

4. **Nested if**  
   An if condition inside another if. Used when one condition depends on another.

5. **switch-case**  
   Best for fixed options (like menu choices or operator-based programs). Compares a variable with several constant cases and executes the matching one.

## Summary of the Programs

1. **Even or Odd Checker**  
   Checks if a number is divisible by 2. Uses the modulus operator and if-else condition to determine and display whether the number is even or odd.

2. **Vowel or Consonant Identifier**  
   Accepts a character input and checks whether it's a vowel using either if-else or a switch case.  
   If not a vowel, itâ€™s treated as a consonant.

3. **Largest of Three Numbers**  
   Takes three numbers and uses else-if ladder or nested if to compare and determine the largest among them.

4. **Simple Calculator**  
   Implements a calculator using a switch statement.  
   Based on the operator entered (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), it performs the respective arithmetic operation.

5. **Switch Case with Break Statements (Profession Selector)**  
   A menu-driven application using switch-case. Displays professions based on the user's numeric choice.  
   A default message is shown for invalid selections.

## Conclusion
Decision-making statements are vital in building logical and interactive C++ programs.  
This project demonstrates how to:
- Use **if**, **if-else**, and **if-else-if** for checking conditions.
- Use **switch** for cleaner handling of multiple constant choices.

Understanding these concepts lays the groundwork for more advanced topics like **loops**, **functions**, and **algorithms**.
